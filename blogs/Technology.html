        <h1>TECH History</h1>
        <p>his begins with the Chalcolithic Age, during which humans first produced copper tools. Next was the Bronze Age, which saw the advent of bronze tools and the first advanced human civilizations. Following was the Iron Age, during which humans adopted iron technology and established the first large empires.
          Thomas Edison created the world's first industrial research laboratory and is known as the father of technology.
          Early humans who invented technology did so with the motivation to have the power to change their environments. When technology was invented, people were able to use technology to meet human needs, wants, and desires. An example of early technology is fire.
