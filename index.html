            <p class="card-text">Technological development is a process in which the application of new knowledge related to technology has visible practical results. These results can be new products, services or processes, always developed with the aim of achieving some kind of advancement.
              The Rules are based on an obligation to treat all prisoners with respect for their inherent dignity and value as human beings, and to prohibit torture and other forms of ill-treatment. They offer detailed guidance on a wide variety of issues ranging from disciplinary measures to medical services.

              Basketball began in 1891, it was invented by James Naismith, as being a less injury-prone sport than football. He was a 31-year-old graduate student when he created the sport, keeping players indoors during the winter. The game became established quite quickly, and it grew very popular into the 20th century.

        <h1>Nelson Mandela`Biography</h1>
        <p class="old italicised" id="special">Rolihlahla Mandela was born into the Madiba clan in the village of Mvezo,
          in the Eastern Cape, on 18 July 1918. His mother was Nonqaphi Nosekeni and his father was Nkosi Mphakanyiswa
          Gadla Mandela, principal counsellor to the Acting King of the Thembu people, Jongintaba Dalindyebo. In 1930,
          when he was 12 years old, his father died and the young Rolihlahla became a ward of Jongintaba at the Great
          Place in Mqhekezweni1.

          Hearing the elders stories of his ancestors, valour during the wars of resistance, he dreamed also of making
          his own contribution to the freedom struggle of his people.

          He attended primary school in Qunu where his teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave him the name Nelson, in accordance
          with the custom of giving all schoolchildren “Christian” names.

          He completed his Junior Certificate at Clarkebury Boarding Institute and went on to Healdtown, a Wesleyan
          secondary school of some repute, where he matriculated.

          Mandela began his studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University College of Fort Hare but did not
          complete the degree there as he was expelled for joining in a student protest.

          On his return to the Great Place at Mqhekezweni the King was furious and said if he didnot return to Fort Hare
          he would arrange wives for him and his cousin Justice. They ran away to Johannesburg instead, arriving there
          in 1941. There he worked as a mine security officer and after meeting Walter Sisulu, an estate agent, he was
          introduced to Lazer Sidelsky. He then did his articles through a firm of attorneys - Witkin, Eidelman and
          Sidelsky.

          He completed his BA through the University of South Africa and went back to Fort Hare for his graduation in
          1943.

          He Known and loved around the world for his commitment to peace, negotiation and reconciliation, Nelson
          Rolihlahla Mandela was South Africa's first democratically elected president (1994-1999). Mandela was an
          anti-apartheid revolutionary and political leader, as well as a philanthropist with an abiding love for
          children.

            <h1>Basketball history</h1>
            <p class="even italicised">Basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, by
              Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as a less injury-prone sport than football. Naismith
              was a 31-year-old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors during the
              winters.
              Basketball, game played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, usually indoors.
              Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponent`s goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and
              net called a basket.

              (Read James Naismith`s 1929 Britannica essay on his invention of basketball.)

              The only major sport strictly of U.S. origin, basketball was invented by James Naismith (1861-1939) on or
              about December 1, 1891, at the International Young Men`s Christian Association (YMCA) Training School (now
              Springfield College), Springfield, Massachusetts, where Naismith was an instructor in physical education.


              For that first game of basketball in 1891, Naismith used as goals two half-bushel peach baskets, which
              gave the sport its name. The students were enthusiastic. After much running and shooting, William R. Chase
              made a midcourt shot—the only score in that historic contest. Word spread about the newly invented game,
              and numerous associations wrote Naismith for a copy of the rules, which were published in the January 15,
              1892, issue of the Triangle, the YMCA Training School`s campus paper.

              While basketball is competitively a winter sport, it is played on a 12-month basis—on summer playgrounds,
              in municipal, industrial, and church halls, in school yards and family driveways, and in summer
              camps—often on an informal basis between two or more contestants. Many grammar schools, youth groups,
              municipal recreation centres, churches, and other organizations conduct basketball programs for youngsters
              of less than high school age. Jay Archer, of Scranton, Pennsylvania, introduced “biddy” basketball in 1950
              for boys and girls under 12 years of age, the court and equipment being adjusted for size.

              In the early years the number of players on a team varied according to the number in the class and the
              size of the playing area. In 1894 teams began to play with five on a side when the playing area was less
              than 1,800 square feet (167.2 square metres); the number rose to seven when the gymnasium measured from
              1,800 to 3,600 square feet (334.5 square metres) and up to nine when the playing area exceeded that. In
              1895 the number was occasionally set at five by mutual consent; the rules stipulated five players two
              years later, and this number has remained ever since.
